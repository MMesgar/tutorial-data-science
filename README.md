# Tutorial on Data Science

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks about different aspects of data science. 
The notebooks should help a junior data scientist learn about tools that are used to complete a data science project. 
They should also help to remember common packages, commands, hints, and technques for data science. 
I also recommed reading my weblog on  [data science](https://mohsen-mesgar.io/blog/datascience/) to learn about data science terminologies. 

**Please give the repository a star on top right. Feel free to suggest how we can improve it together. Don't learn along and share it with others.**


# Credits
Most of the materials in this project are initialized by the matrials in the data science [course]() given by IBM. 
I suggest taking this course as this is very well organized. 
However, I may add new experiments and obervations in to the repo to clarify the topics.
